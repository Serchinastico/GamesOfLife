# Games of life

My playground for the different games of life, in the lookout for cool generative art.

## Elementary Automata

This is entirely based on [Wolfram's Elementary Cellular Automatons](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html).

## Life Automata

Variations of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).

### Rorschach

I made a happy accident and swapped x and y while calculating neighbors for a given cell. The result is a mirrored animation that resembles Rorschach tests.

### RGB Enemies

I'm trying to emulate 3 rival civilizations that will fight for territory

## Ideas

- Use blender for better renders
- Mix colors in game of life
- Use more neighbors in game of life - different _neighboring_ definition
-
